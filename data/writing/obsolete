I know only how to use a hammer, but all the furniture needed has already been made.</br>
Forests have been felled, but Men have been homed, given beds on which to fuck,</br>
tables on which to dine, floors on which to watch their toddlers learn to walk.</br>
Now we're left with these hammers in our hands, and nothing left to make.

Many now just pulverize trees under their hammers, thrash the rubble around.</br>
They say they're building something new.</br>
They seem determined to get us there. They've picked their Ozymandias.

I remain here, with no other tools at hand. Do I stay in my little corner, whittling my tchotchkes, just hoping not to be disturbed?</br>
Do I try to pick up a new tool, despite how morphed my hands have become to this hammer?</br>
Nothing else feels natural, nothing else feels at home in my palm.
