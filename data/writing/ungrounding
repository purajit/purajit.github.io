<h1 class="writing-title">Ungrounding | 2022</h1>

Inch apart we lay, growing up next to each other\
Side by side, dream, wake up, becoming inches taller\
No fight for space, no things, no ownership\
A commune of three budding, a single unit

Roll it up, cover it up at dawn and now we got something to sit on

The bed transformed into a\
Seat transformed into a\
Bed transformed into a\
Seat transformed into a\
Bed

Inch above the ground we lay\
Red light morse code serenading me to sleep\
Hush of secret television static blurring boundaries\
Of who is me and who is she and who is he\
And who are these teeming families

We know this place inside-out\
We know their voices, their kitchens, their backyards\
We know their beats, the rhythm of lives going in and out

Arms apart we live lives that meet at ground level, rooted feet\
Hug our true hugs, feel the hearts\
Separate knowing it's all still the same body

The bed transformed into a\
Seat transformed into a\
Bed transformed into a\
Seat transformed into a\
Bedroom

Bed, this a bed, not a seat\
Seat, this is a seat, not a bed\
Room, it's a room, where you sleep\
Sleep, now it's done privately

There's a dozen doors between us\
We don't grow together\
Just in the same vicinity\
Just out of earshot

There's ownership now\
There's guard dogs now\
There's grass growing atop sickly soils now\
There's fences more than shouts apart now\
There's no humans in this world besides you and I\
There's nothing binding us besides what we pry\
There's no more voices to be heard, just silence and stillness\
There's no rhythm, there's- there's-\
There's no ground

Our lives are no longer porous\
The airs we breathe differ\
Diffuse into eternity\
Just out of earshot
