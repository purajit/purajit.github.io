<div class="writing-title">All the Time in the World | 2021</div>
Let us take a quick trip to the moon and back.
Eternity's too short, let's take our time to pack.
Don't keep a clock, you don't need the time:
Going by the condition now, I'm
Quite certain that we can laze, idle, and slack.

Let's head over to Antarctica and get married.
Let's grow old together and then get buried.
We can go down the Atlantic, we can wade
And set up our home in the Polar shade.
I don't think it'll take long, we shouldn't need
More than a couple years, at most a decade.

Let's watch grass grow till our lovely wedding's
Fiftieth anniversary, it's upcoming
In forty-nine years, but we can wait that long:
Watching grass together will make our marriage strong.

Now that it's time, we should get ready;
But don't hurry up, go slow and steady.
Seriously, spend hours getting dressed my darling,
Because no time is too long when your code's compiling.
