    ever been pushed down, with your head to the ground and a knee to your neck
    
    <br/>while your lungs grasp for air, the air that's the plentiful outside if you're blue
    
    <br/>can't breathe, asthmatic, plastic bag forced over your head
    
    <br/>like you're underwater, like a man charged into your home and grabbed you
    
    <br/>sunk you into the depths of your own sink and went outside and took a stroll
    
    <br/>
    
    <br/>a knee on the grass, too much to bear for a care-free, goldfish hedon
    
    <br/>this private mental eden, protect it, purge it, of anything breaking heaven
    
    <br/>take a breath, and a brush, a flourish and a wreath, and an amen and a tweet to cover your guilt
    
    <br/>flip the quilt of black faces, the blood, to the other side, the dizzying iridescent plastic print of happiness
    
    <br/>
    
    <br/>now it's free-wheeling, burning, bring the conniving down to their knees
    
    <br/>put the flames on speaker for the country to feel what's been said for centuries unaired
    
    <br/>while the synecdoche plays, and the anesthesia wears, the tear gas looming in your midst
    
    <br/>take a sign, loot the screen, fill the time, let the names marquee all day through the night-time
    
    <br/>the television's home, and it's free, and on the screens your family's being stifled
    
    <br/>
    
    <br/>[after a summer of police murders]
