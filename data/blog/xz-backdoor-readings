<h1 class="writing-title">[eng] xz backdoor readings</h1>

List of readings to understand the scope of the xz backdoor situation.

[Original finding](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4) by Andres Freund. This is the primary source.

[Tukaani blog](https://tukaani.org/xz-backdoor/) where Lasse, the original maintainer, is sending updates. (Tukaani is the group that created and maintains xz)

GitHub actors involved:
* Lasse Collin, the original xz maintainer: https://github.com/Larhzu
* "Jia Tan", the primary bad actor: https://github.com/JiaT75
* "Hans Jansen": https://github.com/hansjans162

This is the current official xz repo, that the original contributor Lasse has already started adding patches to:
```
git clone https://git.tukaani.org/xz.git xz-tukaani
```

Good summaries:
* [Timeline](https://boehs.org/node/everything-i-know-about-the-xz-backdoor) with some useful contexts, mailing list participation by these actors, etc
* [Simplified write-up](https://gist.github.com/thesamesam/223949d5a074ebc3dce9ee78baad9e27) with tons of discussion

Official bugs/reports:
* [Debian bug](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1068024) to request reverting the xz version
* [GitHub issue](https://web.archive.org/web/20240329223553/https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/issues/92#issuecomment-2027816300) on the official GitHub repo about this situation, before GitHub disabled the repo.
* [ArchLinux](https://archlinux.org/news/the-xz-package-has-been-backdoored/)
* [libarchive](https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/issues/2103) dealing with every commit made by "Jia Tan", one-by-one

Context:
* [[Link]](https://www.mail-archive.com/xz-devel@tukaani.org/msg00567.html) Original author talking about their burnout, maintainer burden, and their first mention of Jia Tan
* [[Link]](https://www.mail-archive.com/search?l=debian-bugs-dist@lists.debian.org&q=from:"krygorin4545") Random actor pushing for xz upgrades. Shows up for two messages and disappears.
* [LKML](https://lkml.org/lkml/2024/3/30/188) Lasse responds

The hack:
* [Initial request from Jia Tan](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xz-utils/+bug/2059417) asking to have xz bumped in Debian
* [[Link]](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/pull/10667) - getting the version of xz built by oss-fuzz to build without ifunc, since that would reveal issues
* Links to the sus commits are in the original findings, as well as further discussions
