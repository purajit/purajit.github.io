            <div class="contents-subitem writing">ever been pushed down, with your head to the ground and a knee to your neck
while your lungs grasp for air, the air that's the plentiful outside if you're blue
can't breathe, asthmatic, plastic bag forced over your head
like you're underwater, like a man charged into your home and grabbed you
sunk you into the depths of your own sink and went outside and took a stroll

a knee on the grass, too much to bear for a care-free, goldfish hedon
this private mental eden, protect it, purge it, of anything breaking heaven
take a breath, and a brush, a flourish and a wreath, and an amen and a tweet to cover your guilt
flip the quilt of black faces, the blood, to the other side, the dizzying iridescent plastic print of happiness

now it's free-wheeling, burning, bring the conniving down to their knees
put the flames on speaker for the country to feel what's been said for centuries unaired
while the synecdoche plays, and the anesthesia wears, the tear gas looming in your midst
take a sign, loot the screen, fill the time, let the names marquee all day through the night-time
the television's home, and it's free, and on the screens your family's being stifled
