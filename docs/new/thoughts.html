        i've always loved sans serif fonts, but i'm realizing how much warmth there is to serifs. there's something cold and corporate about sans serif. maybe it's just that it's the current design trend, while sans serifs are used in books. serifs somehow also make font more ... discrete? there's something rather dyslexic about sans serif. maybe the lack of achor points makes them float more.

        almost all new tech services boil down to tricking people that nothing should cost money, making themselves essential, and screwing over all the service providers. they convince people that the only reason shit's expensive is that things are inefficient or not "disrupted". streaming music, streaming movies, food delivery, ride sharing - it's all a grift. and they're all unraveling after having destroyed their respective ecosystems.
