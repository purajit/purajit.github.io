<div class="writing-title">Unbridled Joy | 2021</div>
I look at you across your couch
I'm in your world, mired within your art
Your paintings, hobbies
Everything you've picked up from the humans around you
Has coalesced into this unique space you can truly call home

It excites me so to have you share this with me
Share yourself, your life with me
Stimulates my mind, those caterpillars in my stomach
Burst out of their cocoons, my pupils dilate,
That swirling rush of oxytocin and adrenaline
Overtakes me.
And in the midst of that effervescent glory
That floral burst of ecstasy
I cum.
