    Inch apart we lay, growing up next to each other
    
    <br/>Side by side, dream, wake up, becoming inches taller
    
    <br/>No fight for space, no things, no ownership
    
    <br/>A commune of three budding, a single unit
    
    <br/>
    
    <br/>Roll it up, cover it up at dawn and now we got something to sit on
    
    <br/>
    
    <br/>The bed transformed into a
    
    <br/>Seat transformed into a
    
    <br/>Bed transformed into a
    
    <br/>Seat transformed into a
    
    <br/>Bed
    
    <br/>
    
    <br/>Inch above the ground we lay
    
    <br/>Red light morse code serenading me to sleep
    
    <br/>Hush of secret television static blurring boundaries
    
    <br/>Of who is me and who is she and who is he
    
    <br/>And who are these teeming families
    
    <br/>
    
    <br/>We know this place inside-out
    
    <br/>We know their voices, their kitchens, their backyards
    
    <br/>We know their beats, the rhythm of lives going in and out
    
    <br/>
    
    <br/>Arms apart we live lives that meet at ground level, rooted feet
    
    <br/>Hug our true hugs, feel the hearts
    
    <br/>Separate knowing it's all still the same body
    
    <br/>
    
    <br/>The bed transformed into a
    
    <br/>Seat transformed into a
    
    <br/>Bed transformed into a
    
    <br/>Seat transformed into a
    
    <br/>Bedroom
    
    <br/>
    
    <br/>Bed, this a bed, not a seat
    
    <br/>Seat, this is a seat, not a bed
    
    <br/>Room, it's a room, where you sleep
    
    <br/>Sleep, now it's done privately
    
    <br/>
    
    <br/>There's a dozen doors between us
    
    <br/>We don't grow together
    
    <br/>Just in the same vicinity
    
    <br/>Just out of earshot
    
    <br/>
    
    <br/>There's ownership now
    
    <br/>There's guard dogs now
    
    <br/>There's grass growing atop sickly soils now
    
    <br/>There's fences more than shouts apart now
    
    <br/>There's no humans in this world besides you and I
    
    <br/>There's nothing binding us besides what we pry
    
    <br/>There's no more voices to be heard, just silence and stillness
    
    <br/>There's no rhythm, there's- there's-
    
    <br/>There's no ground
    
    <br/>
    
    <br/>Our lives are no longer porous
    
    <br/>The airs we breathe differ
    
    <br/>Diffuse into eternity
    
    <br/>Just out of earshot
    
    <br/>
