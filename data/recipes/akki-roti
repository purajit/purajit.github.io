    "Mix in with akki hittu and water. Dough should be relatively on the dry side, but not crumbly. You should be able to stretch a small ball quite a bit without it tearing",
    "Grease pan, take a ball of dough and flatten onto pan, pressing with fingers",
    "Make hole in the middle, pour some oil, cook. You mostly need to cook one side; when the bottom is almost finished, cover to lightly steam the top",
    "Leave it on longer to make it crispier",
    "Cool down the pan before the next. Having two pans helps",
    "Akki dosa is an alternative that can be made easier; it's similar, and uses a watery batter"
