<div class="writing-title">misunderstood waters | 2024</div>
Oh Great Lakes of yore, you breath of living life
How you lie here, drained of your essence
Your basin is beautiful, don’t misread my words
     there’s a calm stillness to you now,
     a lack of blue
     that just seemed to be pulling you back.

Now you can live your best life without the burden
Of those millions of megatons of server coolant above you

it is said that when we approach pangea ultima there will be no place for you anyway.
you might become a hill, you might end up at the bottom of the ocean
   and be covered in water once again. some electrolytes would do you good.

unlike the beings before us we don’t consume water anyway.

we just ingest it
  and return it back
  as hot piss
  in the middle of the desert.
