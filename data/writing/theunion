<h1 class="writing-title">The Union | 2023</h1>

as of this morning, you've been found be out of check, out of check\
in the year of our lord you've been deemed a pest, deemed a pest

you're out of check, out of check, out of check, mass unrest\
you're a pest, you're a pest, you're a pest, not oppressed\
put through the test, through the test, through the test, litmus test\
do you attest? do you attest? do you attest? do you object?\
you will confess, divest, expel, eject\
outcasted, in exile, deserted by all of man en masse

you oppose it? you're a pedophile\
oh you posit? you're the death of us all\
put you in with the pitifuls\
leave us be, give us freedom and a pistol\
and fentanyl

what you're feeling, it's average\
you're not human, you're inanimate\
we'll rid you all from tampa to anchorage\
you're garbage, stay away from our emirate

when you speak you're harangued\
how much heat can you stand?\
we bear torches, understand?\
still want to fight, for this land?

you wanna stand? gotta stand\
you wanna hang? gotta hang\
wanna hand? got a tank\
gutter land? gut this land\
you'll be fed to this hole\
drained of your soul\
machinations of toll

you want comfort? it's dead\
you want blind hope? it's dead\
you want housing? it's dead\
healthcare? here's a cigarette\
pharmaceutical figure head\
lead faucet and a death bed\
blood bucket at a net debt\
dead dead dead
